# Grade Calculator - nstr.dev

This is a grade calculator / dashboard that I built to have a better overview of my current academic performance. I was tired of always having to calculate the grade required to pass a subject. And to be honest, the grade dashboard of my school kinda sucks. The UI is horrible, and it doesn't show enough information for my needs. That's why I developed my own dashboard. 

## Key Features

- Modern design thanks to shadcn/ui components and Tailwind magic
- Customizable numeric grade scale
- Visualizing your grades using graphs and charts
- View the grades you need to pass a subject at a glance
- Supports grade weights
- See the subjects you struggle in summarized
- Option to wipe account data from the database
- Cloud synced for easy access anywhere
- Log in using your service (currently `Discord`, `Google`, `GitHub`)
- Desktop first, but the mobile interface works well thanks to responsive design
- [Legacy version](https://legacy.grades.nstr.dev/) available for usage without account and cloud (unmaintained but has most features the cloud version does)
- Exporting and importing your grades made easy

## Screenshots

The following examples use the [swiss grade system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_systems_by_country#Switzerland):

|Best grade|Worst grade|Grade required to pass|
|-|-|-|
|6|1|4|

You can change these values according to your needs inside the grade calculators settings. 

*Note: only numeric grading scales are supported at the moment. You can use percentages instead, if you use a letter grading scale. I will try to add this feature soon.*
